Question 1:
Your answer: C (RSA)
Correct! RSA is an example of asymmetric encryption.

Question 2:
Your answer: A (Implementing a DMZ)
Incorrect. The best option for segmenting a network and improving security in a flat network design is C (Deploying a VLAN).

Question 3:
Your answer: C (HTTPS)
Correct! HTTPS provides encryption for data in transit and is commonly used for secure web browsing.

Question 4:
Your answer: D (Spyware)
Incorrect. The type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software but performs malicious activities secretly is C (Trojan).

Question 5:
Your answer: D (To perform a risk assessment)
Incorrect. The primary purpose of a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is B (To assess the potential impact of disruptions to critical business operations).

Question 6:
Your answer: A (An exploit that is released on the same day that a vulnerability is publicly disclosed)
Incorrect. A zero-day exploit is D (An exploit that the vendor has known about for zero days), meaning the exploit occurs before the vendor is aware of the vulnerability.

Question 7:
Your answer: B (Enhanced encryption and security over its predecessor)
Correct! WPA3 provides enhanced encryption and security compared to its predecessors.

Question 8:
Your answer: B (Asset Lifecycle Examination)
Incorrect. ALE stands for A (Annual Loss Expectancy) in risk management.

Question 9:
Your answer: D (Session Hijacking)
Incorrect. The attack involving the unauthorized interception and relaying of authentication requests is C (Man-in-the-Middle).

Question 10:
Your answer: A (A password and a PIN)
Incorrect. Two-factor authentication typically involves two different types of authentication factors. C (A password and a smart card) is an example, combining something you know (password) with something you have (smart card).

Overall, you got 3 out of 10 correct. This is a good start, and remember, practice is key
